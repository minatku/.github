## About this project

MinatKu is an application created to fulfil the capstone project in the Bangkit programme. This project was composed by 7 participants from Bangkit 2023 Batch 2, with 3 from Machine Learning, 2 from Mobile Development, and 2 from Cloud Computing.

### Background
MinatKu addresses the issue of students in Indonesia often selecting college majors that do not align with their interests, as evidenced by the Indonesia Career Center Network (ICCN) reporting that 87% of students admitted to this misalignment in 2017. This mismatch between students and their chosen fields has significant adverse effects, including unfulfilled potential, financial burdens, motivation decline, increased stress, career delays, and job market incompatibility. Through a 5 whys analysis, we've identified that poor career guidance and a lack of self-evaluation resources are contributing factors. Additionally, limited facilities and resources hinder a comprehensive understanding of student interests, talents, and career goals.

### Purpose
Our team initiated this project in response to a pressing issue revealed by the Indonesia Career Center Network (ICCN), where 87% of students in Indonesia admitted to selecting college majors misaligned with their interests in 2017. Recognizing the significant impact this misalignment has on individuals and the country's economy. Through a 5 Whys analysis, we identified issues like poor career guidance, a lack of self-evaluation resources, and a misalignment of educational priorities favoring academic curricula over comprehensive career guidance. Our project stems from the desire to address these challenges and empower students to make informed choices for their future.
